        <h1>Black Hole 101</h1>
        <p>
            Embark on an educational journey to learn the fundamentals of black holes. Whether you're a curious soul or a young aspiring astronaut, this section aims to provide basic yet intriguing insights into these cosmic enigmas.
        </p>
        <h2>What are Black Holes?</h2>
        <p>
            A black hole is a region in space where the gravitational pull is immensely powerful, so much so that nothing, not even light, can escape from its grasp. Imagine the mightiest vacuum cleaner in the universe, sucking in everything nearby; that's a black hole for you! They come into existence when massive stars, much bigger than our Sun, run out of fuel and collapse onto themselves.
        </p>
        <h2>History and Discoveries</h2>
        <p>
            Black holes aren't a recent discovery. Their existence was speculated as far back as the 18th century. However, it was not until Albert Einstein's theory of relativity that the concept gained ground. Though Einstein himself was skeptical, subsequent research and observations cemented the idea. The name "black hole" was humorously coined in the 1960s by physicist John Archibald Wheeler, and it stuck!

        <h2>Properties and Structures</h2>
        <p>
            A black hole is not just a simple void in space. At its very heart lies the singularity - a point with immense density, where all the mass of a black hole is concentrated. This is where our understanding of physics breaks down. Wrapping the singularity is the event horizon, an invisible boundary beyond which nothing can escape â€” it's like the point of no return in a river leading to a waterfall.

        <h2>Formation and Evolution</h2>
        <p>
            How do these mysterious entities form? Stars are fueled by nuclear reactions in their cores. When a particularly massive star exhausts its nuclear fuel, it can't withstand its own gravity and collapses. This can trigger a supernova explosion, leaving behind a core. If this core's mass is more than about three times that of the Sun, it becomes a black hole. Over time, black holes can grow by absorbing surrounding matter or merging with other black holes.

        <h2>Did You Know?</h2>
        <p>
            Not all black holes are the same! They are classified based on their mass. The smallest ones, called "primordial black holes," are believed to have formed right after the Big Bang and are as small as a single atom but with the mass of a mountain! Then there are "stellar black holes" formed from collapsed stars, and the largest of them all, the "supermassive black holes," found at the center of most galaxies, including our own Milky Way!
